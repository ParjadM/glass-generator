Advanced Glassmorphism CSS Generator
Live Site: glassgenerator.ca

An interactive, feature-rich web application for creating beautiful and modern glassmorphism (frosted glass) effects. This tool provides a live preview and generates production-ready CSS and HTML code, empowering developers and designers to build stunning user interfaces with ease.

About The Project
Glassmorphism is a popular UI trend that creates a sense of depth and hierarchy by simulating a frosted glass effect. While the core concept is simple, achieving a polished and unique look requires fine-tuning multiple CSS properties.

This project was built to solve that problem. It provides an intuitive, all-in-one interface to control every aspect of the glass effect, from basic transparency and blur to advanced features like noise overlays and detailed box shadows. The goal is to accelerate the design and development workflow, allowing users to go from idea to implementation in seconds.

This project is a demonstration of modern front-end development skills, built entirely with vanilla JavaScript and styled with Tailwind CSS.
